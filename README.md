# Change Detection in High-dimensional data streams

This repository contains code for detecting concept drift in high-dimensional data streams: We achieve that by reducing the dimensions of high-dimensional data with an autoencoder and detecting drift by applying ADWIN on the reconstruction error of the autoencoder
